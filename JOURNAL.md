## 10/19/2025 - Thinking of what ideas  

I was thinking of which kind of bey to make: attack, defense, stamina or balance. Then i decided it would be best to make the launcher first.
I have no previous experience with 3d printing so I watched a couple of tutorials about onshape. I made a good gear ratio, 1:4 (more than 1.5x the regular beyblade x launcher) to get higher speeds because why not.

I haven't made a grip or a way to hold up the gears because I forgot lol.
